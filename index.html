                                Iâ€™m a seasoned iOS Engineer and Mobile Development Manager with 15 years of experience delivering high-performance mobile solutions for enterprise-scale systems and high-growth environments. I specialize in crafting native mobile applications using Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, and Core Data backed by solid backend knowledge in Node.js and Postgres.

                                Currently, I lead mobile development at Tommyâ€™s Express Car Wash, overseeing a portfolio of mission-critical
                                applications deployed across 200+ franchise locations. I manage a team of four developers responsible for
                                maintaining and evolving multiple Point of Purchase (POP) systems and the Tommyâ€™s Express consumer app for iOS and
                                Android. In early 2024, I led the complete rebuild of the exterior wash POP software and developed a new system for
                                interior wash operationsâ€”both native applications built using the latest Apple technologies.

I emphasized on the importance of a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD) workflow, utilizing powerful tools such as CircleCI and Fastlane, to ensure efficient and automated deployment to both TestFlight and the App Store.

The application was downloaded by thousands of users and it was receiving positive feedback from the users. The app was also featured in the App Store's featured list. The application's success is attributed to the collaboration and hard work of the team, and the use of the latest technologies and best practices in the mobile development process.

This allowed me to create a seamless user experience, and ensure that the system was responsive and easy to navigate. I also set up the Docker system and pipeline, which ensured that the system would be staged once pushed. This streamlined the entire process, making it easy for the company's clients to access the system.

They were thrilled to have the opportunity to win cool prizes, and it helped to strengthen their relationship with 14FOUR. Overall, I am proud of the work I did on this project, as it was completed on time, within budget, and exceeded the client's expectations.

My role in this project was to create a custom system from the ground up, utilizing the latest technologies such as Nuxt/Vue, PUB, and SCSS.

                                                <p>
                                                    I was responsible for setting up the entire Docker system and pipeline, ensuring that the website would stage properly once pushed. Additionally, I incorporated custom animations for the countdown timer and sound bars, adding a unique and engaging touch to the website.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    One of the most challenging aspects of this project was building everything from scratch, but it was also the most rewarding. I was able to use my expertise in web development to create a seamless and user-friendly website that was optimized for both performance and aesthetics. The end result was a website that was not only visually stunning but also highly functional, which was a testament to my skills as a developer.

                                                    Overall, working on the Pepsi and NFL Halftime Show project was an incredible experience. It was an honor to be a part of such a high-profile event and have the opportunity to work with such a talented band. I am proud of the work that I was able to accomplish and am excited to continue to work on similar projects in the future.

This project required me to use heavy CSS animation techniques to create visually appealing and dynamic ads. I utilized various fading and blending effects to make the ads stand out and capture the attention of the audience.

I made sure that the ads were optimized for different screen sizes and devices, ensuring that they would look great on any platform.

I was able to deliver high-quality ads that not only met the client's expectations but exceeded them. The positive feedback received from the client was a testament to the hard work and dedication that I put into the project. I am proud of the final result and look forward to working on similar projects in the future.

However, our team was determined to deliver the best possible outcome. We worked closely with the designer to bring the website's design to life, and the other developer and I were responsible for implementing the design using cutting-edge technologies.

We were able to demonstrate our skills and work as a team under pressure. Additionally, the website we built served as a great foundation for future hackathons. Unfortunately, the website was not implemented but it was a great exercise to see what we were capable of creating in a short period of time.

                                                    As a web developer, I was tasked with the responsibility of implementing new slides to a website for a well-known brand, Mountain Dew, and Speedway.com. The website was built using VUE.js framework, which is a popular JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. I was faced with the challenge of taking over this project as it had been handed off to multiple other developers over time.

After gaining a clear understanding of the project, I set out to implement the new slides, utilizing my expertise in VUE.js framework and various other packages. I worked closely with the design team to ensure that the new slides were in line with the overall design and aesthetic of the website.

The new slides not only enhanced the overall user experience but also helped to increase the website's traffic. I am proud of the work that I accomplished on this project and am confident that my skills and experience will be an asset to any future projects.

My main responsibility on this project was to create a few pages and implement certain features that helped to enhance the overall user experience.

I had the opportunity to work with a talented group of developers who were all committed to delivering an exceptional product. The website was built using VUE.js, which is a powerful framework that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Despite the pressure, my team and I were able to deliver a high-quality website that met all of the client's requirements.

                                                    The project that I was a part of was a replica of the website bbdosf.com. However, it had a unique twist to it as I was tasked with building several new modules that were specifically used on this website. The website was built using VUE.js, which is a popular JavaScript framework known for its ability to create interactive user interfaces.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In addition to VUE.js, the backend of the website was powered by Element API and Craft. Element API is a plugin for Craft that allows you to easily create a JSON API for your website. This was perfect for this project as it allowed for a seamless integration of the front-end and back-end of the website.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Craft, on the other hand, is a content management system that is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. It was an ideal choice for this project as it allowed for easy management of the website's content and also provided a robust platform for the new modules that were built.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Overall, the project was a challenging but exciting experience. The combination of VUE.js, Element API, and Craft allowed for the creation of a website that was not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly. The new modules that were built added a unique touch to the website, which helped to differentiate it from the original.

                                                    As a web developer, I was tasked with building animated banner ads for Church's Chicken. Using the latest technologies such as React, JavaScript, and SCSS, I created a custom banner system that was tailored to the specific needs of the client. The banner ads that I developed required heavy use of CSS animation techniques such as fading and blending, to create dynamic and engaging visuals that caught the attention of the target audience.
                                                </p>

                                                    One of the key challenges of this project was to ensure that the banner ads were optimized for different screen sizes and devices. I had to use responsive design techniques to ensure that the banner ads looked great on both desktop and mobile devices. Additionally, I had to pay close attention to the client's branding guidelines and ensure that the banner ads were consistent with their existing visual identity.
                                                </p>

                                                    Overall, the banner ads that I developed for Church's Chicken were a huge success. They helped increase the company's online visibility, and drove more traffic to their website. The client was thrilled with the final product and praised my attention to detail and ability to create visually stunning and engaging banner ads. I am proud to have played a role in helping Church's Chicken achieve their marketing goals, and I am excited to continue working on similar projects in the future.

                                                    I was tasked with updating a project that had been passed down to me. The project required several updates to the login process, language options, and views. Additionally, the project needed to be deployed in a more efficient manner. To accomplish this, I utilized my expertise in VUE.js and IBM's custom framework to make the necessary changes.

                                                    One of the major updates I made was the implementation of a custom animation that appears at the beginning of the assessment. This animation not only adds an aesthetic touch to the project but also helps to guide users through the assessment process. The animation was designed to be visually engaging and easy to understand, making the assessment more user-friendly.
                                                </p>

                                                    I also took the time to improve the login process and make it more secure. By implementing additional security measures, I was able to ensure that only authorized users could access the assessment. Furthermore, I added language options to cater to a diverse user base. This enabled users to take the assessment in their preferred language, making the process more accessible.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Finally, I streamlined the deployment process, making it more efficient and reliable. This resulted in faster and more reliable access to the assessment for users, reducing downtime and improving overall user experience. Overall, my efforts helped to improve the overall functionality and usability of the project, making it a more effective tool for users.

                                                    The project required a lot of custom modules to be built from scratch, using a combination of PHP, JS, HTML and CSS. The custom modules were designed to provide a streamlined experience for users, allowing them to easily navigate through the different sections of the website and complete the admissions process without any hassle.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    One of the most challenging aspects of this project was ensuring that the website was fully responsive and optimized for different devices. I had to carefully test the website on various screen sizes and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that it looked great on all devices.

                                                    Overall, I am proud of the final product that I delivered to Sacred Heart Schools. The website is functional, visually appealing, and easy to use, making the admissions process more convenient for both the school staff and prospective students.

The project required the use of cutting-edge technologies such as React, JavaScript, and SCSS. My goal was to create visually appealing, animated banner ads that would effectively promote the brand and drive sales.

I was able to add interactive elements such as hover effects and scrolling animations, which made the ads even more engaging and memorable.

                                                    As a web developer, I was tasked with creating a landing page for Doritos to inform customers that their promotion had ended. The page was designed to be simple and straightforward, with the main goal of clearly communicating the end of the promotion to users. The project was completed in August 2020, and the landing page was built using the latest web development technologies such as Vue.JS, Docker, PUG, and SCSS.

This involved updating the design and layout to reflect the end of the promotion, as well as making any necessary technical changes. I made sure to use best practices and the latest web development technologies to ensure that the website was optimized for both performance and user experience.

The website redesign also received positive feedback from users and helped to improve the overall user experience. I am proud of the work that I accomplished on this project, and it is a great example of my skills as a web developer.

                                                    As a web developer, I recently had the opportunity to work on an exciting project for Gatorade. The task at hand was to create a quick landing page for one of their upcoming events. I was thrilled to take on this challenge and put my skills to the test.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    To bring this project to life, I utilized several cutting-edge technologies such as Vue.JS, Docker, PUG, and SCSS. Vue.JS, a progressive JavaScript framework, allowed me to create a dynamic and interactive user interface that would engage visitors. Docker, a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, made it possible to create a highly portable and scalable environment. PUG, a high-performance templating engine, allowed me to write clean and maintainable code. Lastly, SCSS, a CSS preprocessor, enabled me to write reusable and organized styles.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The result was a visually stunning and responsive landing page that effectively conveyed the excitement and energy of the event. The page was designed to be user-friendly, providing visitors with all the information they needed to know about the event and how to participate. It also included a call-to-action that would encourage visitors to register for the event.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In conclusion, I am extremely proud of the work I did on this project, and I am confident that it will be a valuable asset for Gatorade in promoting their upcoming event. The use of cutting-edge technologies and my attention to detail ensured that the final product exceeded expectations.

                                                    The MAVSDK-Swift example app is a valuable tool for developers interested in utilizing MAVSDK in their own Swift projects. The app is completely built with Swift and ReactiveX/RxSwift, making it a great resource for developers looking to integrate these technologies into their own projects. The app serves as a clear and concise example of how to interact with MAVSDK and control UAVs through the MAVLink protocol.
                                                </p>

                                                    As a developer, I am proud to have created an innovative and user-friendly app called People Game. Utilizing the latest technology in Swift, I was able to develop an iOS app that allows users to find friends and make new connections in their immediate location.
                                                </p>

                                                    The app operates by allowing users to create an activity, such as playing a game of basketball or going for a hike, and then choose the number of other people they want to involve and the time they want to meet. The real-time finder feature then presents users with the location of each participant in the activity, making it easy for everyone to meet up and engage in the activity together.
                                                </p>

                                                    One of the unique features of People Game is that after the activity is completed, the activity is deleted and no information is stored. This ensures that user privacy is protected and that the app is not used for any nefarious purposes. Overall, People Game is a fun and easy way to connect with like-minded individuals in your area and make new friends.

                                                    The app features a classic hangman game, where users are presented with a word and must correctly guess the letters in order to complete the word. As users progress through the game, they will encounter increasingly challenging words, making it perfect for learners of all levels. Additionally, the app also features a variety of different categories, such as animals, food, and transportation, to keep users engaged and interested in learning.

                                                    As a parent, I understand the importance of making learning fun and interactive for children. That's why I originally built this app for my daughter. I wanted to create a tool that would help her learn and practice English spelling in a way that was both enjoyable and effective. And as a result, I believe that Hangman by Lucky English is the perfect app for parents, teachers, and anyone else who is looking for a fun and interactive way to improve their English language skills.

                                                    After an extensive year of development and testing, the much-anticipated app was finally deployed on December 1st, 2018. The team and I had put in countless hours of hard work and dedication to bring this project to fruition.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The development process began with the creation of a prototype, which was built as a hybrid app using the Ionic Framework. The prototype was then further developed and transformed into a native app for iOS using Swift. The app was designed to provide a seamless user experience and was optimized for performance and stability.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In addition to building the app, I also built the server, bot for data collection, and an administrator dashboard using Angular and NestJS. This allowed for real-time data collection and monitoring, making it easier for the company to stay informed about their user's engagement and preferences.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The administrator dashboard was designed with ease of use in mind, making it easy for the company to manage and monitor the app's performance. With this powerful tool, they can make data-driven decisions to improve the app and provide a better experience for their users.
                                                </p>

                                                    Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding experience to be a part of such a complex and dynamic project. The app's success and positive feedback from the users is a testament to the hard work and dedication put in by the entire team.

                                                    I participated in a Hackathon located in Chengdu, Sichuan, where my team and I emerged victorious, winning first place. Our project was an app that aimed to revolutionize the shipment assignment process in China.
                                                </p>
                                                    Currently, in China, drivers need to manually bid on shipments and make calculations for themselves, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Our app, Quickload, solves that problem by automating the shipment assignment process. With Quickload, the selection process happens instantly, and it ensures that vehicles are not overloaded, thereby reducing the chances of accidents and damage to the cargo.
                                                <p>
                                                    We spent a considerable amount of time researching and analyzing the current shipment assignment process in China before we began developing the app. We found that there was a significant gap in the market, and we knew that our app could fill that gap and make a significant impact.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The Hackathon was a challenging and intense experience, but it was also incredibly rewarding. My team and I put in a lot of hard work and dedication to make Quickload a reality, and to see it win first place was an incredible feeling. We are excited to see how Quickload will change the shipment assignment process in China and make it more efficient and safe for drivers.

                                                    I was part of a team that was tasked with taking over and completely rebuilding a fleet vehicle management software. The initial project had been built using PHP and MySQL, but we recognized the need to modernize the technology stack. Our goal was to create a more efficient and user-friendly solution for managing fleet vehicles.

                                                    To achieve this, we decided to convert the backend to NodeJS and MongoDB and the frontend to Angular4 and Ionic. This allowed us to create a more responsive and dynamic user interface, as well as improve the overall performance of the software. One of the most significant features we added was a mobile application that would allow drivers to track their vehicles in real-time. The App was then built in Swift for iOS devices.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    We also added several other features to the software, such as real-time analytics and reporting, automated maintenance schedules, and improved security and compliance. The result was a powerful and intuitive fleet vehicle management solution that was well-received by our clients and helped them to improve their operations and save costs.

The company was looking for a website that would effectively showcase their products and allow customers to easily search and find the information they needed. Additionally, the company wanted to have a blog system that would allow them to keep customers informed about the latest developments in the industry.

The blog system is easy to use and allows the company to easily post and manage content, making it an essential tool for keeping customers informed and engaged.
